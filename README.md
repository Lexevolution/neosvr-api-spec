# neosvr-api-spec
This repo will hopefully become a mostly complete OpenAPI sepcification of the Neos VR API.
This will all be unofficial of ocurse, so expect the specification to be out of date or broken at times.
Also for anyone using this to create anything with the Neos API, please follow the [Neos Guidelines](https://wiki.neos.com/Guidelines) and [EULA](https://store.steampowered.com/eula/740250_eula_0).
